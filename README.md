# SQL Homework - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts
In this excercise we created schemata for 6 separate tables containing employee and business data for the purpose of analyzing various characteristics about the data sets.
##Step 1:
Create schema for each table in PGAdmin4
##Step 2:
Import the data from csv files into EmployeeSQL Database that was created in PGAdmin
##Step 3:
Write SQL queries directly in PGAdmin using query editor function
##Step 4 (Bonus):
Using SQLAlchemy, data from PDAdmin database was imported into Python so that data analysis and plotting could be performed
